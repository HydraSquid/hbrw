This can be done so long as you possess a substantial piece of that creature, such as a lock of the creature's hair, their fingernails, blood, or a scrap of clothing, all of which are consumed whether or not you succeed. The chosen creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the taglock is succesfully created, binding that creature to an effigy. If the effigy is already bound to a creature, its binding is replaced. On a successful save, nothing happens, and you cannot attempt to bind that creature again for the next 24 hours. A willing creature can choose to fail this save. A {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell remove curse} spell ends this effect, destroying the taglock.",
